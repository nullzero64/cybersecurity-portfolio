# Apply filters to SQL queries

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to filter SQL database tables to retrieve specific data relevant to analysis and security. You’ll learn how to use AND, OR, and NOT operators to refine your queries, understand the syntax for each, and see the results of applying these powerful filters. Mastering these filtering techniques will help you efficiently extract and analyze information from large datasets.

## Summary

Efficiently filtering data is crucial for security analysis and decision-making. By using SQL operators like AND, OR, and NOT, you can quickly isolate relevant events—such as failed logins after work hours, activity on specific dates, or actions outside a particular region. These skills empower you to extract actionable insights from your databases and better protect your organization, making your data handling both targeted and effective.
