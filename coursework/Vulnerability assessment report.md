# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The purpose is to give a security audit on any vulnerabilities that could be present with the database.

* *A database is valuable as it can hold a lot of personal information, including but not limited to passwords and usernames, or even emails.*  
* *Securing the database is important so that attackers cannot view the contents of the database and steal user information or steal their account credentials, use them, and even be used for impersonation.*  
* *If the server that was hosting the database was disabled, it could cause a pause in operations as retrieval of data would not be possible.*

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hacker | Obtain personally identifiable information via the Database and exfiltrate it. | *2* | *3* | *3* |
| Competitor | A Competitor could see within the database, and if they believe they have a better business model, could contact customers that have data stored in the database. | *3* | *1* | *2* |
| Malware/Malicious Software | Can be used to disable or harvest all information within the database with ease of automation. | 2 | 3 | 3 |

# **Approach**

The likelihood of a threat is very likely, and securing the database with an InfoSec team is recommended.

# **Remediation Strategy**

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
