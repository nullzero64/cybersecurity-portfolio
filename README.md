# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!



## Introduction
I am a cybersecurity beginner sharing my journey, projects, experiences, skills, and resources.

## About Me
I became interested in cybersecurity after experiencing several cyber attacks myself, starting when I was young and enthusiastic about computers, video games, and technology. I have used computers and grown up with the internet, and I‚Äôm passionate about learning how to defend, analyze, and improve digital security.

## My Goals
- Become a SOC1 Analyst.
- Pursue penetration testing and move into red teaming.
- Develop malware for red team operations.
- Eventually become a malware analyst.
- Acquire the certifications needed to start my cybersecurity career and become a true professional.

## Learning Platforms
- **TryHackMe:** Introduced to many different and cool tools through the Pre-Security and Beginner paths; completed the SOC1 path.
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate:** Halfway through the certificate; have learned a lot about Linux, Bash, SQL, filtering data in SQL tables, and using tools like `apropos` to match commands to tasks.

## TryHackMe Room Experience (Exploits)
- **Blue:** Learned about the EternalBlue (MS17-010) exploit, performed enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation steps. Gained familiarity with using Metasploit for exploitation and post-exploitation.
- **Ice:** Practiced Windows enumeration, privilege escalation, and exploitation techniques, deepening understanding of Windows attack surfaces.

*Familiar with classic exploits such as EternalBlue (MS17-010), as practiced in the TryHackMe "Blue" room.*
